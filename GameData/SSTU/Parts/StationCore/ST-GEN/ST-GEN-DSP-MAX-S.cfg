description = SSTU - StationCore: Deployable Solar Panel - MAX-S - The 'Multi-AXis' line of solar panels was a breakthrough in the application of the 'more is better' school of engineering.  The designers added a second set of servomotors to the tracking system of the solar panel allowing it to track the sun on multiple axis, resulting in more consistent and reliable energy generation. Compact when folded up, and with a decent energy density, the Station Core line of solar panels are an effective means of long term energy generation.
