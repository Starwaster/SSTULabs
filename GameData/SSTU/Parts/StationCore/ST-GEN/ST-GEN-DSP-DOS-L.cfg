description = SSTU - StationCore - Deployable Solar Panel - DOS-L - Originally developed for the DOS station modules, these solar panels have since found uses in other spacecraft and station designs.  Compact when folded up, and with a decent energy density, the Station Core line of solar panels are an effective means of long term energy generation.
