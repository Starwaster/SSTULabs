description = SSTU - StationCore - Deployable Solar Panel - SMA-L - The 'Service Module' series of solar panels was, surprisingly, not the result of a large and expensive research project.  Instead of hiring a team of costly engineers and scientists, the project lead gave some unpaid interns a box of model solar panel parts and chose the best of the resulting designs.  Regardless, we think they work well for stations, service modules, and probes.  Compact when folded up, and with a decent energy density, the Station Core line of solar panels are an effective means of long term energy generation.
