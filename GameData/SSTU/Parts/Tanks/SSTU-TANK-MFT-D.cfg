manufacturer = SSTU
description = SSTU - ShipCore: Tanks - Booster Tank.  These special shaped booster tanks were widely acclaimed as a breakthrough in application of common sense to rocketry, while at the same time being criticized as being 'too pointy!'.  Intended to form the radial booster stage of the Series-A spacecraft.  Available in any diameter and a wide range of lengths, the SSTU Modular Fuel Tank is the right choice for all of your fuel storage needs.  Includes selectable mount options as well as variable diameter, length, and paint-scheme.
